# r-script-containerized

This repo shows a simple demonstration for how to containerize an R script for reproducibility and sharing. This is very useful for researchers to share code with other researchers or to their future selves. We show how to build and run Docker containers. Users of the R script can run a single `docker run`  command which will launch an Rstudio server instance which can be accessed through a web browser.The Rstudio server instance will have the R script and all of its dependencies installed. This ensures a consistent environment for running the R script and producing the same results.  


The R script takes a drone-based point cloud (.laz) and produces a digital terrain model (DTM.tif)

```
#Enable packages we will use in this script
library(RCSF)
library(raster)
library(lidR) 
library(sp)

#Set working directory to the mounted volume on your local machine
setwd("/home/rstudio/data")

#Bring point cloud into our environment
point_cloud = readLAS("hole17_point_cloud.laz")

#Ground filter using cloth simulation filter
ground = classify_ground(point_cloud,  algorithm = csf(sloop_smooth = FALSE, class_threshold = 0.2, cloth_resolution =  0.3, rigidness = 3))

#Make a point cloud with only ground points
ground_points = filter_poi(ground, Classification == 2)

#Create a digital terrain model (DTM) from the ground points. Resolution of 10 cm. 
DTM = grid_terrain(ground_points, res = 0.1, algorithm = knnidw(k = 10, p = 2))

#Write the the raster DTM out to the mounted volume on your local machine
writeRaster(DTM, filename="DTM_test.tif", format="GTiff", datatype='FLT4S', overwrite=TRUE)
```
